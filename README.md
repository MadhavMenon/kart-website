I have used the Express module to create the server as well as for all my routes
The Mongoose module is used to connect MongoDb to my website 

The public folder has all the static files
The models folder has all the Schema and the model creation
The views folder has all the pug files(yet to be completed)
The route folder contains all the routes
The utils folder has the apifeatures file which is used for the queries
The controller folder contains files that provide the funcitonality to the routes
There are view Controllers and View Routes files that are the routes for the pug files and files to render the pug files
The app file has all the middleware
The server file starts the server provides security and handles errors

The pug files have not benn added as of now
The required security and error handling will be added  which will go into the server file
The basic skeleton for the website has been added to the repository
The website has the MVC architecture for a server side rendered website
